Datapane is a Python library which makes it simple to build reports from the common objects in your data analysis, such as pandas DataFrames, plots from Python visualisation libraries, and Markdown. 

Reports can be exported as standalone HTML documents, with rich components which allow data can explored and visualisations can be used interactively.

For example, create a report with a table viewer and an interactive plot:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
from datapane import LocalReport, Table, Plot
​
df = pd.read_csv('https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v7/finance/download/GOOG?period1=1553600505&period2=1585222905&interval=1d&events=history')
chart = alt.Chart(df).encode(x='Date', y='High', y2='Low').mark_area(opacity=0.5).interactive()
​
LocalReport.create([
    Table.create(df), 
    Plot.create(chart)
])
```

Would create an HTML report such as this, with an interactive Table and Plot component.

In addition to the this local library, Datapane.com provides a hosted platform which allows you to:

1) Share and embed your reports online
2) Upload your Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts, so that others can run them online in order to generate reports dynamically.
